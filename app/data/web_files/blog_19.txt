Title: McKinsey food system study helps drive over $65 million to small restaurants

Description: At one restaurant, Matt and fellow cooks threw out every romaine leaf to get to the last two baby leaves. And if those two weren’t facing each other, they couldn’t be plated and went in the trash.

Content: <blockquote><p>I’m really inspired by practicality and execution. As I saw how much food was thrown away, I wondered if this fine dining precision existed in the emergency food space, I quickly discovered that it didn’t and became obsessed with building a system that delivered food equitably and sustainably. I thought it was the most basic thing I could do—help take this food and ensure I can get it to somebody.</p><p>- Matt</p></blockquote><p>Matt left the kitchen and founded <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.rethinkfood.org/">Rethink Food</a> in 2017 in New York City, a nonprofit working to bridge the gap between excess food and the communities that need it. It has since donated over 24 million meals and rescued over 2.4 million pounds of food from being wasted.</p><p>What began as primarily a food rescue operation evolved into also providing small grants to restaurants to make meals for places like community centers and shelters. Historically, food is trucked into these facilities from large industrial kitchens outside New York City. Keeping food delivery local not only cuts down on emissions but supports neighborhood businesses and offers immigrant and ethnic communities food they know and like.</p><blockquote><p>Instead of bringing in generic food from Pennsylvania to a senior center in Chinatown, we supported local restaurants to make the meals that match the needs and cultural preferences of the local community, It just makes so much sense.</p><p>-  Matt</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We put the data behind Rethink Food’s thesis that this local-sourcing model has many benefits. </p><p>- Tejas Shah</p></blockquote><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejasshah2/">Tejas Shah</a>, a McKinsey partner in New York who led the pro bono team that conducted the study. The team developed a framework to compare and measure Rethink Food’s decentralized restaurant network to the centralized catering model by conducting a series of interviews and integrating insights from case studies and analyses to understand the impact of Rethink’s model and scaling potential.</p><p>The study’s positive findings were exciting, but not surprising to the McKinsey team: the same dollar of funding for buying meals creates 50 percent more jobs through the Rethink model than the large-caterer model, and 75 percent of those jobs are local to New York City.</p>
